- 👋 Hi-ho! The name's Frank!
- 👀 Making stupid little programs is my favorite thing to do in my off-time. I love tech, and I hope to make programs to help others!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning multiple programming languages, since I'm starting college soon. It's a good idea to have some knowledge beforehand!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on literally any project! I want to make a difference and help others.
- 📫 You can reach me at my Twitter [@BlackFrankFTM2X](https://twitter.com/BlackFrankFTM2X/)!
